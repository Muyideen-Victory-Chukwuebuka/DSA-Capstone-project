# DSA-Capstone-project
DSA Capstone project :- this is my first ever attempt on data analysis. Where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the incubator 

So I tried to analyzing this data and it was challenging. I almost gave up trying when ever I meet a roadblock. And God it wasn't easy but I was able to do at least 9 questions out of 11. 

## Project Topic: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

By analyzing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data
